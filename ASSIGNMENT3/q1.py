# Write a Python program that demonstrates the use of multiple assignment and tu-
# ple unpacking shortcuts. The program should perform the following tasks:

# • Prompt the user to enter three numbers separated by spaces.
# • Use a single-line assignment to store each number in its own variable (x, y, z).
# • Swap the values of y and z in one line using tuple unpacking.
# • Print the values of x, y, and z before and after the swap to show the effect of
# the shortcut.
# Example Output:
# User input: 5 6 7
# Before swapping: x = 5, y = 6, z = 7
# After swapping: x = 5, y = 7, z = 6

num=input('Enter three numbers seperated by spaces')
x,y,z=map(int,num.split())
print(f"Before swapimg x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
y,z=z,y
print(f"After swapimg x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
